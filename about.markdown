Was everything better before?
For me, it is hard to see past the illusions that are caused by modern society, I believe I have lost my original opinion and personality due to consuming too much social media and valuing the opinions of others as facts. One day as I was thinking about how much I have changed because of my connection to the internet I asked myself a question, at which point did parts of society become entrenched in others' opinions and ideas? What factors drove this change?

There are many questions that I have. But there are also many things that make answering these questions complicated. There are so many things that have led up to our current time, we are a very diverse society, so I assume that there is more than one answer to each of my questions and I am prepared to find as man as possible.

I will use this site to share the answersw to my questions, I wish to share any knowledge that I can here!
